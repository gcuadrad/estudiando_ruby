String methods:

**It is conventional in Ruby to have '?' at the end of the
 method if that method returns only boolean values.

- .include?() = detects when the string includes 'Yoda'
  ex: "[Luke:] I canâ€™t believe it. [Yoda:] That is why you fail.".include?("Yoda")

- .start_with? detects whether the string starts with 'Ruby'
 ej:"Ruby is a beautiful language".start_with?("Ruby")

- .end_with() = Detects whether the string ends with 'Ruby'.
 example:"I can't work with any other language but Ruby".end_with?("Ruby")

- .index() = finds the index of letters
 "I am a Rubyist".index("R")

 - .downcase, .upcase = converts the statement to downcase/ upcase.
 ex:'This is Mixed CASE'.downcase

 - .swapcase = swaps the case of every letter in the statement
  ex: "ThiS iS A vErY ComPlEx SenTeNcE".swapcase

- .split = splits the string on space
 ex: 'Fear is the path to the dark side'.split

- .concat(), +, << = concat strings.
 ex:"Ruby"<<("Monk")
- .sub() = replace a single subtrings
ex: "I should look into your problem when I get time".sub('I','We')

- .gsub() = replace all subtring.
 ex: "I should look into your problem when I get time".gsub('I','We')
